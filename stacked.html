                            of packages from door to
                            door as easy and convenient as possible. It has been made with not only personal users in
                            mind but also any type of
                            commercial environment. With the main challenge being to find a system that will allow all
                            tracking software to present
                            any special information that they provide.

                                        <p>To begin, I wanted to find out the main issues people had with tracking
                                            parcels
                                            from a personal perspective as well as a
                                            commercial one. I opened with interviews with potential users of the app to
                                            see
                                            what their views were. All three of the
                                            individuals worked for an IT company that offered support, which included
                                            buying
                                            IT products for their clients, so I was
                                            able to get the personal and commercial point of view. I found out their
                                            keys
                                            points that allowed me to make user
                                            personas that would encompass the vast majority of the potential users of
                                            the
                                            app.

                                    <p>After working on the site map, I made an overall site flow of how users would go
                                        around the site. Due to the site only
                                        having one primary function I was able to keep the map simple and reduce any
                                        unnesserssry steps.</p>

                                        and if they have a profile, they would
                                        go through these steps. This will allow me to design the site with a strong
                                        knowledge of what the current and next step
                                        they will do, making sure I can make it as easy and functional for the user.</p>

                                    <p>Before going any further it was necessary to perform some user testing to find

                                        the user testing, I organised all of the results into an affinity map to see
                                        what worked and the issues that arose, as
                                        well as potential solutions that would be included in future iterations of the

                                        associated with the website, trying to incorporate different aspects and
                                        emotional responses to the logo. I kept the
                                        logos black and white to make sure the styles throughout the design would work
                                        with the logo irrespectively to the
                                        location or any external factors.</p>

                                            some of the pages being split in half, it allows two 6 column grids so

                                            The mobile grid uses an 8 column grid. This is a lot more than is usually

                                            number of options and information that needs to be displayed. The higher
                                            amount of columns allows more freedom in the
                                            design and makes the design feel less boring and repetitive

                                    <p>The design uses illustrations throughout to signal to the user, the brand and

                                        parcel is currently at.

                                        The illustrations bring a little fun to the design, giving the page's character
                                        and at first glance will inform the user
                                        what is going on without having to read. Even though the site has a language
                                        setting this will allow users to be able to
                                        interpret the design, whether they are able to read the words or not.

                                    <p>All items in the type scale use Futura PT, making use of a variety of weight
                                        available, Bold, Light and Book.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Futura PT is a pro variation of the 1927 Paul Renner font “Futura”. It has a
                                        stylish and modern feel while being very
                                        legible and scalable to the user's needs. The reason I used the “PT” version is
                                        due to the increase in font variations
                                        as well as the font having a more consistent x-height through the font.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The design uses large titles and smaller text, due to the design needing to
                                        display information fast but not mass
                                        amounts, the larger typeface speeds up interpretation and gives it a style that
                                        suits the branding

                                    <p>Creating the branding for the application, It needed to be a modern professional
                                        design that focused on being
                                        functional, so it would be suitable in a professional environment as well as in
                                        personal.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The design needed to translate the modern feel throughout the design so I went
                                        for a gradient colour scheme of green and
                                        blue, that meets the current modern trends. A colour gradient has been used as
                                        an overlay over imagery to give the
                                        design a more complex feel as well as giving it a greater aesthetic look.

                                    <h1>Measuring Success</h1>
                                    <p>This project has not been made to work as of yet, this is only the mock UX/UI
                                        behind the site. But if this project is
                                        made and were to go live I would measure success in three different ways:</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>
                                            Amount of package searches made</li><br>
                                        <li>
                                            Amount of accounts made
                                        </li><br>
                                        <li>
                                            The amount of returned package tacking without errors failed searches or
                                            abandoned
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>A fourth measurable success that would be available is in the amount of returning
                                        users to the site mainly including in
                                        profiles that have been made and regularly checked and updated to include new
                                        tracking.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="measuring-Sucess-Right">
                                    <h1>Next step</h1>
                                    <p>The next step for this project will be to complete a second full wave of user
                                        testing to future scrutinise the usability
                                        of the application. After further interactions of the site, then the goal will
                                        be to pass this on to a development team,
                                        in the hopes to try and get the back end of this application made.

                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                <br>
                                <p>The UI and usability seemed to have a positive reaction when shown to users, after
                                    asking them to complete a similar
                                    task as the one done on the original user testing, the tasks were done faster with a
                                    more positive response.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    This passion project has helped me to further develop my UX and UI skills by showing
                                    me that interviews and testing
                                    prove to be one of the greatest tools when creating a project. It also showed me
                                    that although I could be seen as the
                                    targeted demographic, I am not the only one using the site, so referring to others
                                    even in the same situation provides
                                    invaluable information about the development of the application.
