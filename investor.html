                        <p>Inside Investor is a financial investment company that had a very low conversion rate as well
                            as a low user retention
                            time on their site. They also felt their design was outdated and need to be refreshed. The
                            goal of this task was to
                            create a more professional and trustworthy brand as well as increase the conversion rate of
                            users entering the site and
                            submitting a form. The main challenge of this project was to create a system that allowed
                            uses to enter an amount as
                            easily as possible but didn't suggest any amount beforehand so they invest what they are
                            comfortable with.

                                    <p>We kept the original slider CTA on the re-design as the client informed us that
                                        they had done a previous test and found
                                        that to be the best. The re-design increased the conversion rate by 12% from 7%
                                        to 19%. This was of users going onto the
                                        site for the first time and clicking through the first CTA.

                                        Where this is an improvement we didn't have any data other than this one number
                                        of first time users clicking the CTA and
                                        sending a form so from previous experience it felt like this number was low for
                                        the design.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        We decided to A/B test different CTA on the landing page to see if we could
                                        increase this rate. After research and
                                        previous experience on a similar site, we opted for 3 different CTA’s and
                                        decided to test a more impactful colour scheme
                                        to see if we would increase the conversion rate.

                                        landing page of the site this time was
                                        appropriate. The issue came that users were not clicking on any of the links on

                                        The client specifically wanted users to click through the different sectors they

                                        Due to the success that the graphically striking landing section had on

                                        <li>The first measure of success will be if we did what we were contracted to,
                                            increase conversion rate. With the orginal
                                            rate being 7% and by the end of the project we had the rate at being 32%, I
                                            would consider this project a success
                                        </li>

                                            The second would be to increase people clicking through the different
                                            investment industries. We increased this by 215%
                                            from the re-design which we suspect was high than the original, they had no
                                            data on this so we can't say for sure. I was
                                            also consider this project in that aspect a success too

                                        </li>

                                            Finally, the last measure would be if we increased the amount of time users
                                            spent on the site. We averaged 3:30 - 4 per
                                            user which I would also consider to be a success

                                        submitting forms and using the site in general. I would have liked to run more
                                        A/B tests on the site as I believe we
                                        could have increased the conversion rate even higher if we had more data to work
