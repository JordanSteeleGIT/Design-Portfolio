                            the clients</h2>
                        <p>Impact is an energy company that specialises in boiler, insulation, and heat solutions. They
                            needed a site that
                            communicated to the customers that they are trustworthy and a professional brand. They had
                            some prior branding and
                            wanted to keep it but create a clean and modern-looking website. The main challenge for this
                            project was creating a site
                            that reflected what the brand was about while keeping within their outdated branding. (The
                            logo has been changed for
                            legal purposes)

                                    <p>After having a firm sense of who I was designing for and what their goals
                                        are
                                        going to be when using the website I moved
                                        on to create a minimal site map that would direct all of the users to
                                        their
                                        goal
                                        desitnation with minal time lost.

                                    <p>Finally I decided the last step that needed to be taken before moving to
                                        wireframes was to create a site flow for the
                                        user. I did this as I wanted to make sure that there is no areas of the
                                        site
                                        where the users would feel they are wasting
                                        time and would have to restart

                                            grid on
                                            mobile from a 12 on desktop, the design needed
                                            to make sure it doesn't look too asymmetrical as that would create a
                                            disconnect between the desktop and mobile.

                                        branding. A baby blue was added to the site
                                        as this gave the site background some depth instead of keeping it all

                                        Due to the clean nature of the font, it is very legible which was

                                        highlight on the site to be green, to represent
                                        the brand.

                                    <p>When looking back on this project I am not totally happy with the final
                                        product,
                                        I feel like there are too many elements
                                        that float and are not anchored to anything, and feel the design can
                                        have a
                                        cramped feel to it in some sections. This
                                        being said these issues and outlined fixes to these issues have been
                                        brought
                                        up
                                        to the client who said they preferred
                                        the current version rather than a fixed one.

                                        <br><br>
                                        I have hope that when it comes out of dev, I will be able to change some
                                        elements to try and make it a more well-rounded
                                        site.
