                        <p>In-store retail shopping has become less popular due to the convenience of the online
                            equivalent.
                            This application
                            should bridge the gap between online and in-person by enhancing the user's experience of
                            in-store shopping by allowing
                            them access to online functionality. The app should allow users to enjoy in-store retail
                            shopping with the app adding
                            additional features to increase the experience. The main issues this app is looking to
                            resolve
                            are common issues
                            in-store retail have such as long queues, lack of stock availability, etc...

                                        but flexible for all of the small
                                        icons needed throughout the design.

                                        Due to the whole app being only mobile the grid doesn't need to change.

                                        phone it is being displayed on. The base grid will have 50px colomns

                                    <p>The colour scheme has been kept neutral to only using black and white,
                                        but to
                                        give
                                        the app a sense of branding I have
                                        also introduced an accent orange colour throughout the design.
                                        <br><br>

                                        The reason black and white have been kept as the main colours is to not
                                        take
                                        away
                                        from the photos, as these are the main
                                        focus point of the screen. The neutral palette has also been used so
                                        that
                                        this
                                        application can work with a range of
                                        different companies, so their branding and images won't have negative
                                        effects on
                                        the
                                        application.

                                        Futura PT is a pro variation of the 1927 Paul Renner font “Futura”. It

                                        legible and scalable to the user's needs. The reason I used the “PT”
                                        version
                                        is

                                        to the increase in font variations
                                        as well as the font having a more consistent x-height throughout

                                            The first way I will measure the success of this project is if it
                                            provided
                                            an
                                            answer to the original challenges that
                                            were outlined at the start of the project, would it reduce user
                                            wasted
                                            time
                                            and
                                            frustration and create a COVID safe
                                            highstreet environment. I feel like the app did to a point, any
                                            other
                                            feature
                                            would need a lot of shop
                                            cooperation</li><br>
                                        <li>
                                            Whether the application would be scalable to be rolled on a global
                                            basis. At
                                            this
                                            point, I would say no as I feel like
                                            it needs more user testing in real-world shopping environments
                                        </li><br>
                                        <li>
                                            Finally, I would measure success on the quality of the design and
                                            increases
                                            to
                                            the
                                            overall user’s experience while
                                            shopping. I would say this does but needs further user testing to
                                            fix
                                            issues
                                            that
                                            cannot be found unless appropriate
                                            retail environmental user testing would be completed.

                                        like with further user testing in the correct environment I will be able
                                        to
