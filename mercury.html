                    <p>In-store retail shopping has become less popular due to the convenience of the online equivalent.
                        This application
                        should bridge the gap between online and in-person by enhancing the user's experience of
                        in-store shopping by allowing
                        them access to online functionality. The app should allow users to enjoy in-store retail
                        shopping with the app adding
                        additional features to increase the experience. The main issues this app is looking to resolve
                        are common issues
                        in-store retail have such as long queues, lack of stock availability, etc...

                                <p>The Grid uses a symmetrical 6 column grid that allows the designs to stay symmetrical
                                    but flexible for all of the small
                                    icons needed throughout the design.

                                    Due to the whole app being only mobile the grid doesn't need to change. The layout
                                    grid padding will change to fit the
                                    phone it is being displayed on. The base grid will have 50px colomns with 8px
                                    gutters that are able to scale up and down
                                    for the size of the phone screen.

                                <p>The colour scheme has been kept neutral to only using black and white, but to give
                                    the app a sense of branding I have
                                    also introduced an accent orange colour throughout the design.
                                    <br><br>

                                    The reason black and white have been kept as the main colours is to not take away
                                    from the photos, as these are the main
                                    focus point of the screen. The neutral palette has also been used so that this
                                    application can work with a range of
                                    different companies, so their branding and images won't have negative effects on the
                                    application.

                                    Futura PT is a pro variation of the 1927 Paul Renner font “Futura”. It has a stylish
                                    and modern feel while being very
                                    legible and scalable to the user's needs. The reason I used the “PT” version is due
                                    to the increase in font variations
                                    as well as the font having a more consistent x-height throughout
